          Hi,
          <br /> I am Remoan Toumani
          <br /> <br />a front-end developer hailing from Syria. My journey into
          the world of web development was sparked by a fascination with the
          internet's inner workings. Over time, I've become proficient in HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, constantly refining my skills to stay ahead in
          the ever-evolving landscape of front-end development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new design concepts, experimenting
          with different frameworks, and contributing to open-source projects. I
          believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I'm
          always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible in web
          development.
        </p>
